1.3.1 (2022-11-11)
------------------

1.3.0 (2022-11-10)
------------------
* Merge melodic-devel-staging `#617 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/617>`_ from ros-industrial/melodic-devel-staging
* ur_description: Make robot name configurable on load_ur.launch (`#612 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/612>`_)
  In 9d02ccadc8fb9b5cfeaf0d5b0c0c7708d2461447 robot launchfiles were forwarded
  to their specialized launchfiles instead of setting the robot model in the
  load_ur.launch file.
* Fixed ur5 base height (`#607 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/607>`_)
  The visual and collision mesh of the base of the ur5 has to be moved 3 mm upwards in order to close the gap between the shoulder and align its bottom in the xy-plane. Otherwise the ur5 collides with the surface it is directly placed on.
* Merge pull request `#602 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/602>`_ from fmauch/fix_deprecation_warning
  fixing deprecation warning
* fixing deprecation warning
* ur_description: Use the per-model xacro files for correct robot name (`#588 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/588>`_)
  With the common xacro file the robot name will always be "ur".
  However, the moveit config packages expect the robot name to be e.g. "ur10e".
  This commit will use the macros containing the model name already.
* Increase minimum CMake version to allow builds on Focal Fossa (Noetic) (`#586 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/586>`_)
* Merge pull request `#562 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/562>`_ from fmauch/convenience_macros
  Add convenience macros for description files
* Replace _\_ prefixes (`#579 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/579>`_)
  With newer versions of xacro this leads to errors otherwise.
* description: provide convenience top-levels and macros.
  These avoid users having to provide values for *all* arguments of the 'ur_robot' macro.
  In many cases, users will want to keep the default files for the joint limits, physical and visual parameters, and only override the default kinematics (to use extracted calibration fi).
  With the provided wrapper macros, this is possible, as variant-specific defaults are provided for all arguments, requiring only to override the required ones.
  Users looking to include a UR into a larger scene or composite xacro macro should 'xacro:include' these '_macro.xacro' files.
  The top-levels are only useful when loading a stand-alone UR in an otherwise empty scene. They do not allow access to any arguments and only use the defaults.
* description: main macro xacro is not a top-level.
  So move to include directory.
* Merge pull request `#533 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/533>`_ from gavanderhoorn/yaml_ctors_rosparam_joint_limits
  description: spec limits in degrees.
* description: spec limits in degrees.
  Use rosparam's and xacro's support for these special constructors to convert to radians on-the-fly.
* Merge pull request `#520 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/520>`_ from gavanderhoorn/fix_yaml_loading
  Load yaml files in read_model_data(..), nowhere else
* description: delegate loading yaml files to read_model_data(..).
  This avoids having to 'remember' to load_yaml(..) the contents of those files in every user of the 'ur_robot' macro, and seems to conform to the idea behind the '\*_parameters_file' naming of the parameters (they're paths to files, not yaml strings).
* Merge pull request `#516 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/516>`_ from gavanderhoorn/convert_limits_files
  Use 'ros_control style' joint limit files
* description: load values from new params.
  'ros_control format' uses different names, so use them.
* description: they're joint limits.
  Not joints limits.
* description: load new joint limit files.
* description: convert joint limit files to 'ros_control format'.
  This allows re-using them with MoveIt and ros_control hw interfaces.
* description: rename limit files.
  Bring in-line with other joint limit files.
* description: add missing safety_ctrlr for shoulder pan. (`#514 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/514>`_)
* description: correct joint limits for all supported variants. (`#513 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/513>`_)
  Based on values from the User Manuals.
* description: fix main macro docs. (`#512 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/512>`_)
* Merge pull request `#505 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/505>`_ from gavanderhoorn/fix_base_link_orientation
  Remove incorrect base_link rotation.
* description: correct orientation of Base mesh.
  Connector should be aligned with Y+ of 'base' frame.
* description: fix orientation of 'base' frame.
  So it's coincident with the robot's/controller's 'Base' frame. It's actually 180 degrees rotated over Z wrt 'base_link'.
* description: rotate for UR internal frames.
* description: introduce base_link_inertia link.
  To work around the root-link-with-inertia limitation in KDL.
* description: remove the 'base_correction' property.
  There is an offset between 'base_link' and 'base', but it's a fixed one, known and does not need to be a property.
  Rectify the problem with the 'base_link' mesh in a follow-up commit.
* description: assume -0==0. (`#511 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/511>`_)
* description: use mat def from yaml for base_link. (`#509 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/509>`_)
* description: reduce verbosity: pass all args. (`#508 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/508>`_)
  These convenience wrappers only setup defaults, and all args are needed, so pass all of them.
* Merge pull request `#506 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/506>`_ from gavanderhoorn/add_flange_frame
  Add flange frame
* description: use standard comments for base and tool0 frames.
  Aligned with other ROS-Industrial robot support packages.
* description: fix orientation of tool0.
  Now that flange is its parent.
* description: introduce flange frame.
  This is the correct EEF attachment point: REP-103 aligned and no unwanted rotations (as tool0).
* description: remove ee_link link.
  Also remove the tiny collision object, as it's no longer needed now that MoveIt has been fixed.
* description: clarify status of 'inc' xacro files. (`#507 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/507>`_)
  As the way we model the robots may change in the future, users should consider these files as private.
  No guarantees are given as to the existence of these files or their contents.
* Merge pull request `#497 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/497>`_ from gavanderhoorn/desc_updates

  Add Ur16e support
* Updated ur16 files for calibrated URDF
* Updated kinetmatic and physical parameters according to the current PR
* Added missing meshes for ur16e
* Preliminary model version of UR16 added
  This model is only correct in the kinematics structure. Meshes and dynamics
  parameters have to be corrected.

  the kinematics parameters can be retrieved from a calibration mechanism
  to precisely represent the robot's kinematics.
* Merge pull request `#371 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/371>`_ from ipa-led/ur_description_args

* migrated all package.xml files to format=2 (`#439 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/439>`_)
* Merge pull request `#426 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/426>`_ from fmauch/inertia
  corrected dimensions and positions of inertias
* Add optional safety_controller tags to all joints in xacro macros
* Merge pull request `#435 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/435>`_ from fmauch/add_description_view_files
  Add description view files
* Add dependencies for view_x.launch files to the description packages
  As we use the joint_state_publisher, the robot_state_publisher and rviz
  inside the launch files, I added them as run-dependencies.
* Added view_x.launch files for all descriptions to easily check them.
  This resolves `#432 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/432>`_
  To avoid introducing another dependency, I copied the rviz configuration
  from industrial_robot_client.
* corrected dimensions and positions of inertias
  I'm by far not an expert in working with gazebo or inertias, but it seemed wrong to me:
  - The upper arm inertia of the ur10 is not centered in the visual arm segment
  - CoM in the wrist links don't sit inside the correct links. E.g. wrist1 has its CoM inside the end of the forearm for all robots.
  - Because of the second point the inertia's geometry of wrist3 is matching wrist2 instead of the actual moving part of wrist3.
  - Wrist dimensions of ur5 were completely off.
  - On the ur5e the arm inertias weren't centered in the visuals.

1.1.6 (2016-04-01)
------------------
* unify mesh names
* add color to avoid default color 'red' for collision meshes
* use correct DH parameter + colored meshes
* introducing urdf for ur3 - first draft
* unify common xacro files
* remove obsolete urdf files
* description: add '_joint' suffix to newly introduced joint tags.
  This is more in-line with naming of existing joint tags.
* description: add ROS-I base and tool0 frames. Fix `#49 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/49>`_ and `#95 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/95>`_.
  Note that 'base' is essentially 'base_link' but rotated by 180
  degrees over the Z-axis. This is necessary as the visual and
  collision geometries appear to also have their origins rotated
  180 degrees wrt the real robot.
  'tool0' is similar to 'ee_link', but with its orientation such
  that it coincides with an all-zeros TCP setting on the UR
  controller. Users are expected to attach their own TCP frames
  to this frame, instead of updating it (see also [1]).
